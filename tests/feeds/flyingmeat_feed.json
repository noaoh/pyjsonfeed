      "content_html": "<p>Flying Meat has just <a href=\"http://flyingmeat.com/acorn/\">released Acorn 5.6</a>, which is a free update to anyone who already owns Acorn 5.</p>\n<p>What's new and awesome? The big new feature is Touch Bar support for the MacBook Pro. You can now resize your brushes, flip around your canvas, apply boolean operations and align your selected shapes, and much much more. The Touch Bar gives you intuitive control when editing your images, all with a couple of easy taps on your new MacBook Pro.</p>\n<p>If you don't have a new MacBook Pro you're going to like this update anyway because it includes one of our top feature requests: A Photos Extension to edit your images in Acorn. Now with a couple of clicks you can open up your image from Photos, edit in Acorn, then save your image back to Photos. It really is that simple.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://flyingmeat.com/acorn/releasenotes.html\">full release notes</a> are also available.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>Up here at the FM world headquarters, I've recently pushed the buttons and typed the commands to make <a href=\"https://secure.flyingmeat.com/acorn/\">Acorn</a> 5.6.4 roll out to all my favorite people.</p>\n<p>It's purely a bug fix release, but it includes a fix for a 10.12 issue that I've spent way too long tracking down. So if you're on 10.12 Sierra, and you've seen the occasional case where a black box would suddenly appear somewhere on your canvas, this release is for you.</p>\n<p>So start your update engines and grab it today.</p>\n<p>And a small request: if love Acorn and you've <a href=\"http://flyingmeat.com/acorn/appstore/\">purchased it via the App Store</a>, why not leave it a nice review or give it a handful of stars? When we push out new releases, it resets the previous reviews and ratings in the store which is a huge bummer for us (and it also creates a disincentive for releasing bugfix builds! But that's a story for another time). We love getting reviews and ratings though, it's like fuel for future releases.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>The folks behind Code Obsession, creators of Observatory, <a href=\"http://codeobsession.com/observatory/doc/acorn.html\">just put out some new plugins for Acorn</a> to read FITS, XISF and SBIG images:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Code Obsession\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Acorn Plugins add FITS, XISF and SBIG image support to Acorn. After installing the plugins, you can open any such image as easy as a JPEG or TIFF.</p>\n<p>\"Calibrate, align and stack your images in Observatory, export as 32 bits FITS, open in Acorn and start post-processing. Add layers, annotations, watermarks. The options are endless.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I wrote the plugin api to do this years ago, but except for a few small examples it was never really used. However, earlier this week Sander Berents from Code Obsession contacted me about it since Acorn's ability to save 64 and 128 bit images with non destructive filters (ie- curves and levels) was perfect for astronomical data. Acorn 5.6.5 was just about to go out and I made a couple of tweaks to the API for him, and that was that.</p>\n",

      "title": "Acorn 6 Public Beta",
      "content_html": "<p>It's been a long time since we've done a public beta of a major app release. In fact, we've <em>never</em> done this before for Acorn. But we feel now is a great time to open up Acorn 6's beta to the public.</p>\n<p>So we're happy to say that we've got <a href=\"http://flyingmeat.com/download/6/\">Acorn 6 in public beta</a> for you to try out today.</p>\n<p>We're introducing some great new features and refinements, including text on a path, cloning across layers and images, improvements to web export and smart layer export, and new shape stroke options.</p>\n<p>We've also added some great new tools for working with color profiles and wide gamut images, which is becoming more important every day for iPhone and pro photographers alike. You can now load and export color profiles from the Image \u00e2\u0096\u00b8 Color Profile\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 menu. And when you're exporting for the web, you can highlight the areas of your DP3 or wide gamut image which are out of the range of sRGB.</p>\n<p>And there's more of course, <a href=\"http://flyingmeat.com/download/6/\">so why not grab the beta</a>?</p>\n<p>We're doing something new with trials in Acorn 6. The direct version will get its usual 14 day trial, but after that's up you'll be able to still use Acorn to view your images. The only change will be that the tools are disabled if you choose not to purchase it. We're also doing this for the App Store version in Acorn 6. When Acorn officially ships you'll be able to download it for free and \"purchase\" a 14 day trial for $0.00. When that's up you can keep on using Acorn to view your images, or you can unlock Acorn at the usual price. This will make it really easy for App Store customers to download Acorn and try it out.</p>\n<p>Finally- one of the reasons we're doing a public beta, and one of the reasons that we still love working on Acorn, is hearing about what you like and what you think needs improvement. So if you like something- <a href=\"mailto:support@flyingmeat.com\">let us know</a>! And if there's something you'd like to see better- <a href=\"mailto:support@flyingmeat.com\">let us know</a>! And if you hate it- <a href=\"mailto:support@flyingmeat.com\">let us know that too</a>. The feedback we get from our customers is the main driver for changes in Acorn.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://flyingmeat.com/download/6/\">So go grab the Acorn 6 beta already</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Mini FAQ</strong>:<br>If you purchase Acorn 5 directly from us between now and Acorn 6's release, you'll be emailed an Acorn 6 license when it ships. We aren't able to do this for the App Store however (sorry).<br>Acorn 6 requires 10.11.4 or later, including MacOS 10.12 Sierra. Acorn will of course support 10.13 when it comes out in the fall.</p>\n<p>P.S., I'm also using this as an opportunity to kick off our new forums, which you can find at <a href=\"https://forums.flyingmeat.com\">https://forums.flyingmeat.com</a>.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<center><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/flyingmeat/acorn6/newsletter_6_header.jpeg\" width=\"549\" height=\"254\" /></center>\n\n<p>So we <a href=\"http://flyingmeat.com/acorn/\">released Acorn 6</a> today. \u00f0\u009f\u008e\u0089</p>\n<p>It's been a lot of work and it shipped a little later in the year than we planned, but we're really happy to have something awesome for everyone to use. And in addition to that, we've currently got it on sale for 50% off. <a href=\"http://flyingmeat.com/acorn/\">Go grab it</a> for cheap while you can.</p>\n<p>What's new and awesome?</p>\n<p>For a number of years, text on a path has been our number one feature request and we finally got to deliver it with version 6. Acorn has always had great text support; it handles unicode effortlessly, and you can have multiple font faces and weights in a single text block. You can even have emoji as part of your text block. All of these same features work perfectly with text on a path. Inline editing, selection, etc- it just works. And it was a ton of fun to code on as well. Buy me a beer someday and I'll spill the details on how I coded it.</p>\n<p>We also implemented our number two feature request, clone tool improvements. You can now select any layer as a clone source (bitmap layers, a group of layers, even shape layers) and then clone to any other layer, or even another image. We also added stamping to the clone tool, which works by holding down the shift key when you click on your image.</p>\n<p>Wide gamut images are all around us now thanks to newer iPhones and DSLRs, and we wanted to find a way in Acorn to show you where the colors in your image may fall out of the range of sRGB (which is pretty much the current standard color profile these days). We did that by adding an extra option in the web export window, which shows up when your image is wider than sRGB. When turning it on, you'll get a nice view of your image with areas highlighted that fall out of the range of sRGB. There are also options to convert your image to sRGB at that point, either by perceptually matching colors or just by assigning the sRGB profile to your image without touching the source pixels.</p>\n<p>What else is cool? Inner and outer stroke for vector shapes! New boolean options for shapes! Smart Layer Export things! Much improved interactions when cropping, transforming, or other things that used to be modal operations. And more. Full <a href=\"http://flyingmeat.com/acorn/releasenotes.html\">release notes are available</a> (actually- that statement is only partially true. There are a lot of little things we didn't include in the official notes).</p>\n<p>And as mentioned in a previous post, we're doing something new with trials in Acorn 6. The direct version will get its usual 14 day trial, but after that's up you can still use Acorn to view your images. The only change will be that the tools are disabled if you choose not to purchase it. We're also doing this for the App Store version in Acorn 6. You can download it for free and \"purchase\" a 14 day trial for $0.00. When that's up you can keep on using Acorn to view your images, or you can unlock Acorn at the usual price. This will make it really easy for App Store customers to download Acorn and try it out. We're really curious as to how this is going to work out in the long run, and if you choose this option- let us know how you like it.</p>\n<p>And finally, I should mention that Acorn improvements mostly come from ideas from our customers. So if there's something you'd like to see, <a href=\"mailto:support@flyingmeat.com\">let us know</a>.</p>\n<p>Now off to work on the inevitable 6.0.1 release\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</p>\n",

For the one or two of you that this was affecting, hurray!</p>\n<p>Next up is <a href=\"https://flyingmeat.com/retrobatch/\">Retrobatch</a>, which also <a href=\"https://flyingmeat.com/retrobatch/releasenotes.html\">includes some bug fixes</a>, the beginnings of Voice Over support, performance improvements, and more.</p>\n<p>What's next for these apps? Work on Acorn 6.2 will begin shortly, as will Retrobatch 1.1. WWDC introduced some great new APIs that I want to take advantage of (cool new machine learning things), so that'll be a focus- as well as Dark Mode for Acorn and one other major thing I've got planned. Retrobatch will probably also get the Dark Mode treatment, but not until I've done it for Acorn first.</p>\n<p>So it's going to be a busy summer, but I'm looking forward to it.</p>\n",

Well, <a href=\"https://flyingmeat.com/retrobatch/\">Retrobatch</a> now has some great scripting goodness in the form of a new Automator action which will run a workflow for you (and create Automator droplets), a new JavaScript node*, and the ability to run Retrobatch workflows from the terminal.</p>\n<p>We've added a handful of new nodes such as Dither, Auto Enhance, Instant Alpha, and Color Posterize. New options to existing nodes have also shown up, such as \"Only scale smaller\" for the Scale node.</p>\n<p>And an interesting idea that I've had folks ask about a number of times- it's now possible to run an image through a machine learning classifier, and then have the classification written to metadata such as the image title, or keywords. This was done by adding token support to the Set Specific Metadata node. This also means you can use other tokens such as the Current Year in metadata fields. Awesome? We think so.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://flyingmeat.com/retrobatch/releasenotes.html\">full release notes are available</a>, and if you have ideas or questions- make sure to <a href=\"https://forums.flyingmeat.com/\">poke around on the forums</a> or write us: <a href=\"mailto:support@flyingmeat.com\">support@flyingmeat.com</a>.
